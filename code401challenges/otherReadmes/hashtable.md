# Hashtables
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Implementing a hashtable to store the elements as key value pair

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Hashtable accepts any data type as its key or value. Added methods to the hashtable are add, get, contains, hash
and isEmpty.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Elements are stored at the index generated through hashcode. For items with duplicate index, items are added at that 
index in linked list format. Big O of time for adding new item in the hashtable is O(1) as it stores at index generated by hashcode and
doesn't require visiting other elements and Big O space is O(n) for adding new item. 
Searching for new item, time complexity is O(1).
 

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in each of your hashtable -->
add()     : takes in both the key and value. This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, 
handling collisions as needed.

get()     : takes in the key and returns the value from the table.

contains(): takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.

hash()    : takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection.
