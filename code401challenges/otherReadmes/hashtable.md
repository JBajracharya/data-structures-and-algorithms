# Hashtables
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Implementing a hashtable to store the elements as key value pair

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Hashtable accepts any data type as its key or value. Added methods to the hashtable are add, get, contains, hash
and isEmpty.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Elements are stored at the index generated through hashcode. For items with duplicate index, items are added at that 
index in linked list format. Big O of time for adding new item in the hashtable is O(1) as it stores at index generated by hashcode and
doesn't require visiting other elements and Big O space is O(n) for adding new item. 
Searching for new item, time complexity is O(1).
