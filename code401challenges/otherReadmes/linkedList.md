## Challenge Description
Create methods like insert, includes, toString, append, insertBefore, insertAfter, value at index
starting at the end.


## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Insert methods adds node to the beginning of the linked list with Big O time of O(1) efficiency. 
Includes methods iterates through the list to find the matching value and return boolean value.
While looping in most of the method current node is set to next node to iterate through the loop.
